This is the Frontend folder for my Cloud Resume website.

It contains the three classic elements of a static website:
1. index.html (incl. JavaScript code to register visit counter and call AWS API)
2. error.html (with a simple error message)
3. stylesheet.css (copied from Cloud Resume Codepen example, needs to be improved)
